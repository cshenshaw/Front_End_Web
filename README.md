All comic book images and desciptions for this site are from:
Leagueofcomicgeeks.com. (2017). The Comic Geek Community & Free Comic Book Collection Tool.
[online] Available at: http://leagueofcomicgeeks.com [Last Accessed 8 Mar. 2017].

The idea behind this site was to create a simple and clean format(hence the single page) in which the users are able to
view what comics are coming out along with an image of the cover, a dispription and a price. the main focus around the site was making it
so that these features could be updated as and when new comic are released. to do this each comic was set up in a class allowing 
the same style to be used as well as information to easily be added removed or edited.

One of the main features for this site was for the user to be allowed to choose the comics that they would wish to get and 
allow them to see how much this would cost them. This was done using javascript and is shown of a floating dock at the bottom of the screen.

The site has a single breakpoint allowing it to change to mobile, this breakpoint changes text size as well at turning the navigation bar
into a drop down menu. all of the dimentions within the site have been done using % as this allow for it to be reposonsive.
The site works for PC, tablet and Mobile.

the use of the slideshow under the navigation bar is designed to display news from the world of comics (whilst currently displays
relative place holders) because of the intended use of this slideshow it was decided that navigation arrows should be used to allow
users to veiw this content at their own pace rather then rushing to view things.
